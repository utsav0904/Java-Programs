   (Use AWT or Swings, EventHandling for cursor movement & validations. The User Interface should be independent of the 
   backend datastore i.e. file or DB). Save the data to a file, Books.dat.
2. Query a record on the basis of bookid or bookname or authorname or publication should be possible. The data be retrieved  
   from the Books.dat file and displayed in GUI. Also update the records. Deletion of any book record should also be possible.
